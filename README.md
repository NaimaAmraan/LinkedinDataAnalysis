# LinkedinDataAnalysis
This analysis explores a Linkedin dataset based on job postings and applications in India. Through exploring the data, we can see trends in job postings and applications based on work types i.e. remote, hybrid, and on-site.
The inspiration behind looking into work types comes from the current shift in both companies and applicants in terms of job locations. More companies are exploring what works best for them and their employers. At the same time,
applicants could be making application decisions based on whether a role is remote, hybrid or on-site. 

I also include a tableau visualization dashboard for further visual analysis.
